# general_framework_for_portfolio
This project represents a preliminary implementation of a broad portfolio construction framework, primarily inspired by the research paper available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03294.

Some general observations about the paper: it doesn't specifically employ machine learning techniques but instead focuses on the assessment of multiple combinations involving various objective functions, constraints, and forecasting methods. This project is an ongoing effort, and it will take some time to develop the complete codebase necessary to replicate all the combinations outlined in the paper.

Our ultimate goal is to deploy this framework on AWS, but that is a longer-term objective

# Technical details
We use python 3.12 and PDM to manage the environment.
